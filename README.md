# Dstl Satellite Imagery Feature Detection


## Description

I’m surprised at how many times I land on a project page that is obviously popular (because Twitter told me so) but I have no idea why because the project owners don’t tell me plainly what the project is or why I should care.

## Installation instructions 
- Tell me where to get the bits and how to install them

Where to get help - Link to the docs, mailing list, wiki, etc.


## Credits, Inspiration, Alternatives 


- Tell me if this is a fork of or otherwise inspired by another project. I won’t think you’re a douche when I find out later.
