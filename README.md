## [Panchromatic Sharpening](https://www.kaggle.com/resolut/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/waterway-0-095-lb=250x250)  

Pansharpening is a process of merging high-resolution panchromatic and lower resolution multispectral imagery to create a single high-resolution color image. Google Maps and nearly every map creating company use this technique to increase image quality. Pansharpening produces a high-resolution color image from three, four or more low-resolution multispectral satellite bands plus a corresponding high-resolution panchromatic band.

##  [Reflectance Index](https://www.kaggle.com/resolut/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/panchromatic-sharpening=250x250)

The reflectance is used to calculate different reflectance indices, which sum up the large amount of information contained in a reflectance spectrum. Some of them are related to plant biomass, photosynthetic size and radiation use efficiency. Other parameters are related to the physiological status, e.g. water content.
